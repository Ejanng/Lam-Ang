# Main Story

~ lam_ang_scene1_start

Namongan: My son... you've only been alive for nine months. You named yourself the moment you were born, grew into a man in days... but you cannot—

Lam-ang: Mother, you know I'm not like other men. When I first opened my eyes and spoke my name, I knew my purpose. Where is father?

Namongan: He went to Kaigorotan... and never returned.

Lam-ang: Then I will find him. And I will avenge him.

# Can be modified if may time
SYSTEM: *Lam-ang picks up kampilan sword*
# ---------------------------

Namongan: When you asked for your father as a newborn, I knew this day would come. You carry his spirit, Lam-ang.

Lam-ang: I carry the mutya stones. I carry father's courage. The Igorots will answer for what they've done.

SYSTEM: Lam-ang equips two mutya stones, boosting his stats.

Namongan: Then go, my son. But please... return to me. You're all I have left.

~ lam_ang_scene2_start

Lam-ang: (internal monologue) They call this the darkest mountain. Death lingers here. Good. Let death come for those who took my father.

Igorot Scout: Who dares enter Igorotan territory?

Lam-ang: I am Lam-ang, son of Don Juan! I've come for the ones who killed my father!

Igorot Scout: Don Juan? (laughs) His head decorates our chief's spear! You'll join him!

Lam-ang: You'll regret those words.

SYSTEM: Combat Started. Defeat all enemies to proceed. (3 waves)

=> END 

~ lam_ang_scene3_start

Lam-ang: Father... I will honor you.

Igorot Chief: Another warrior from Nalbuan? You people never learn!

Lam-ang: I am Lam-ang, son of Don Juan! I challenge all of Kaigorotan! Every warrior here - face me!

Igorot Chief: Bold words for a boy! Kill him! Throw your spears!

SYSTEM: BOSS FIGHT — Igorot Chief. Defeat him and his warriors!

#Igorot Chief: You have skill, boy. But can you face ME?

=> END 

~ lam_ang_scene4_start

Lam-ang: It's done.

Lam-ang: Father, your death is avenged. Nalbuan is safe. No more raids. No more fear.

Lam-ang: I wish you could have met the man I've become. I hope... I hope I've made you proud.

Lam-ang: I will bring you home. Rest now.

#SYSTEM: Returning to Nalbuan...

=> END

~ act2_scene1_homecoming_start

Namongan: Lam-ang! You've returned!

Namongan: My son... you've done what seemed impossible. Your father's spirit can rest now.

Namongan: But I see it in your eyes—something still troubles you.

Lam-ang: I feel... incomplete. As if there's something more I must do. The battle is won, but my purpose isn't finished.

Namongan: You're a man now, Lam-ang. A warrior. Perhaps it's time you thought of... a wife?

Lam-ang: A wife? Mother, who would want—

Namongan: There is a maiden in Calanutian. Doña Ines Cannoyan. They say she shines like nine flocks of stars in the night sky. Beautiful, wealthy, but... proud.

Lam-ang: Tell me more.

Namongan: She has rejected countless wealthy Castilian suitors! Rich merchants, Spanish officials—none were good enough. What makes you think—

Lam-ang: Mother, I defeated all of Kaigorotan alone. Surely I can win one woman's heart.
 
#SYSTEM: A white rooster with yellow feet struts forward.

White Rooster: Trust in us, Namongan! Your son will succeed where others have failed!

#SYSTEM: A shaggy dog with golden collar trots in, barking twice.

Namongan: Even your animals have more confidence than I do. Very well, my son. But take care—matters of the heart are more dangerous than any battle.

Lam-ang: Then it's settled. I leave for Calanutian tomorrow.

SYSTEM: New Quest: The Courtship of Ines Cannoyan

SYSTEM: Companions Acquired: White Rooster, Shaggy Dog
